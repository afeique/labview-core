EXERCISE 1
----------
3. 
  1 control
  5 indicators
  1 free label
  1 run button
  1 icon
  1 connector pane

5. 
  1 control
  5 indicators
  5 constants
  2 free labels
  

ACTIVITY 1-3: LESSON REVIEW
---------------------------
1.
  a. Front panel
  b. Block diagram
  d. Icon/Connector pane

ACTIVITY 2-1: EXPLORING DATAFLOW
--------------------------------
1.
  Either File Dialog or Simulate Signal nodes execute first

2.
  Simple Error Handler.vi node executes last
3.
  No
4.
  3
5.
  Yes
6.
  Write To Measurement File
  Correct answer: either the Statistics Express VI or the Write To Measurement File Express VI or they execute in parallel
7.
  Write To Measurement File
8.
  Tone Measurements 2
  Correct answer: Either of the Tone Measurement Express VIs can execute last. The Filter Express VI might execute before
    the Tone Measurements 1 Express VI.


ACTIVITY 3-1: REVIEW DEBUGGING TOOLS
------------------------------------
+ Execution Highlighting
+ Single Stepping
+ Execution Highlighting
+ Probe
+ Single Stepping


ACTIVITY 3-2: LESSON REVIEW
---------------------------
1.
  a. A subVI is broken
  c. A required subVI input is unwired
  d. A Boolean terminal is wired to a numeric indicator

2. 
  b. Error: String

3.
  b. False
     Both Errors and Warnings have Non-zero Status Codes
     For Errors, Status = TRUE. For Warnings, Status = FALSE.

4.
  b. False
     The Merge Errors Function does NOT concatenate errors. It returns the first error found. If no error is found,
     it returns the first warning. Use it to propagate errors along wires and merge errors from different wire paths.



ACTIVITY 4-1: While Loops vs. For Loops
---------------------------------------  

Scenario 1
1.
  num measurements == 60 or time == 60
2.
  60
3.
  Both are equally easy to implement



Scenario 2
1.
  pressure >= 1400 psi
2.
  Unknown
3.
  While loop


Scenario 3
1.
  ANSWER: 
  While Loop: 
    [(Last Temperature == Previous Temperature) for 2 minutes or more] &&
    [(Last Pressure == Previous Pressure) for 2 minutes or more]

2.
  Unknown

3.
  While loop


Scenario 4
1.
  Voltage == 5V

2.
  5V / 0.5V = 10 iterations

3.
  Either one



ACTIVITY 5-2: LESSON REVIEW
---------------------------

1.
  b. False

2.
  4 - 5 iterations starting from 0

3.
  b. Type Definition

4.
  d. A type-definition containing a cluster



ACTIVITY 6-1: CASE STRUCTURES REVIEW
------------------------------------
1.
  a. Execute one of its subdiagrams based on an input

2.
  b. One

3.
  a. Lets you wire an input value to determine which case executes

4.
  a. Lets you wire an input value to determine which case executes
